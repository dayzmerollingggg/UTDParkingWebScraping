# UTDParkingWebScraping

Web Scraping using Beautiful Soup (python) for the UTD parking auxillary (https://services.utdallas.edu/transit/garages/). 
Able to look at graph of data averged around days of the week to see when the garage is full at different hours of the day.
Trying to connect with Google Maps to show when the parking garages will have the most traffic getting in/out.
